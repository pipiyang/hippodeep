Brain Hippocampus Segmentation

This program can quickly segment (<2min) the Hippocampus of raw brain T1 images.

It relies on a Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained on thousands of images from multiple large cohorts, and is therefore quite robust to subject- and MR-contrast variation.
For more details on how it has been created, refer to the corresponding manuscript at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2017.11.004

## Requirement
*(new)* (Apr 2018) improved the initial registration step, for a low speed penalty

This program requires Theano >= 0.9.0 and Lasagne

No GPU is required

The ANTs tools are required for the initial low-res registration. Optionally, the FSL tools can be used as alternative.

Tested on Linux CentOS 6.x and 7.x, and MacOS X

## Installation

The code uses the Scipy stack and a recent Theano. It also requires the nibabel library (for nifti loading) and the Lasagne library.

To setup a ANTs environment, get it from http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/ (or alternatively, from a docker container such as http://www.mindboggle.info/ )

The simplest way to install the rest from scratch is to use a Anaconda environment, then
* install scipy and Theano >=0.9.0 (`conda install theano`)
* nibabel is available on pip (`pip install nibabel`)
* Lasagne (version >=0.2 If still not available, it should be probably pulled from the github repo `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip`)


## Usage:
After download, you can run

`./first_run.sh` in the source directory to ensure the environment is ok and to pre-compile the models.

Then, to use the program, simply run:

`deepseg1.sh example_brain_t1.nii.gz`.
    on Windows
    './deepseg1.sh example_brain_t1.nii.gz'
The resulting segmentation should be stored as `example_brain_t1_mask_L.nii.gz` (or R for right).

The volumes values are stored in `example_brain_t1_hippo_vol_LR.txt`, Left then Right, in mm^3. Also, `example_brain_t1_eTIV.txt` has an estimate of the Intracranial-Volume.

*(hint)* to concatenate multiple outputs into a table, you can use a bash shell such as `for a in *_hippo_vol_LR.txt ; do cat $a ${a/hippo_vol_LR/eTIV} | xargs echo $a; done`

## Legacy usage:
Alternatively, if you wish to re-use the same version as described in the manuscript, then you can either run:

Using ANTs tools: `deepseg2.sh example_brain_t1.nii.gz`.

or using FSL tools: `deepseg3.sh example_brain_t1.nii.gz`,

The script can be called with its full path, but the image file must be in current, writable, directory.
## Windows users
1. enable conda environment in cygwin:
    source /cygdrive/c/Anaconda3/Scripts/activate envs_name
